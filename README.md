# System Programming Tasks Using C

This repository contains tasks and practice programs related to
low-level system programming using the C programming language.

## 📌 Description
This repository includes a collection of tasks designed to understand
and practice low-level system programming concepts.
The programs demonstrate how C interacts with the Linux operating system
using system calls and OS-level mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- GCC Compiler
- POSIX System Calls

## 📂 Topics Covered
- File handling using system calls (open, read, write, close)
- File descriptors
- Process creation and control (fork, exec, wait)
- Error handling using errno and perror

## 🎯 Purpose
- To build strong fundamentals in low-level system programming using C
- Understanding OS-level programming in C
- Hands-on learning of Linux system calls

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
```terminal
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
